A file can be classified either as text or binary file.

Files such as source code files, txt files are text files.

Files such as music files, movie files, images, objs, exes are binary files.

When file is opened in text mode and if stream io objects read character with 
character code 26 then that character is treated as EOF character. Also a sequence of
character codes 13 (CR) and 10 (LF) is read as a single character.

This is not so when file is opened in binary mode i.e. character with character code
26 is not treated as EOF character and sequence of character 13 and 10 is not
read as single character.
